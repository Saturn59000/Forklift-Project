# Forklift-Project

This is a raspberry-pi opencv-based project for BCIT's ELEX 4699 electrical system design course.

The given challenge was to sort as many 40mm x 40mm 3D printed packages as possible automatically using opencv and aruco markers, aswell as manually while controlling over the network. The sorting must be done in under two and a half minutes and each box sorted contributes to the final grade of the class. 

This code controls a mini forklift designed by our team, and our first goal is to get the forklift to sort a box automatically within two and a half minutes. We then hope to optimize this to be able to sort multiple packages within this timeframe.

Enjoy!
