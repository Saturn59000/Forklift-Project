# Forklift Project for ELEX4699

# Background
This is a project repository for BCIT's ELEX 4699 electrical system design course. The code in this repository is raspberry-pi and opencv-based.

# Problem
The given challenge was for each 2 team group to sort small 3D printed packages from one side of a 46in x 46in arena to the other using a robot.

Light sensors were used to monitor if the robot exceeded this limit. The robot can be ran manually or autonomously and had 2.5 minutes to sort as many of these packages as possible.

# Our Design
We settled on a more "traditional" forklift design,
